# SNHU Travel Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the SNHU Travel project, a comprehensive travel booking system developed using Agile-Scrum methodologies. The project implements core features including flight search, hotel booking, and user authentication.

## Questions & Reflections

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
User stories are a powerful tool for interpreting and implementing user needs. From my experience with the SNHU Travel project, I demonstrated this by breaking down complex features (like the hotel booking system) into smaller, manageable tasks:
1. First designing the database schema
2. Then implementing basic search
3. Adding room availability checking
4. Finally integrating payment processing

User stories helped by:
- Providing clear acceptance criteria to define success
- Enabling regular stakeholder feedback during sprint reviews
- Allowing for iterative refinement based on user testing
- Making it easier to prioritize features based on business value

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to development, as shown in the SNHU Travel project, emphasizes:
1. Iterative development with regular feedback cycles
2. Breaking down large features into manageable tasks
3. Flexibility to handle requirement changes (like when new security requirements were introduced)
4. Using structured processes for organization and efficiency

Key Agile processes to incorporate in future work:
- Daily stand-ups for team alignment and quick problem identification
- Sprint planning for workload management
- Regular retrospectives for continuous improvement
- Clear documentation and tracking using tools like JIRA

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Based on my experience, being a good team member means:

1. **Communicating effectively**:
   - Giving clear, concise updates in daily stand-ups
   - Following structured communication formats (like "Yesterday I..., Today I..., Blockers...")
   - Documenting thoroughly in project management tools

2. **Being reliable**:
   - Maintaining code quality through testing and documentation
   - Meeting sprint commitments
   - Taking ownership of assigned tasks

3. **Contributing to team success**:
   - Removing impediments for others
   - Sharing knowledge and documentation
   - Being adaptable to change and new requirements

## Project Outcomes
The SNHU Travel project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of Agile-Scrum practices in software development. Through structured processes, clear communication, and regular adaptation, we delivered a robust travel booking system that met user needs while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

## Tools & Technologies
- JIRA for project management
- Git for version control
